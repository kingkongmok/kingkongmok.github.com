## pre-install

+ 默认kernel会缺省少以下模块：

```
 *   CONFIG_CGROUP_DEVICE:       is not set when it should be.
 *   CONFIG_MACVLAN:     is not set when it should be.
 *   CONFIG_VETH:        is not set when it should be.
 *   CONFIG_BRIDGE:      is not set when it should be.
 *   CONFIG_BRIDGE_NETFILTER:    is not set when it should be.
 *   CONFIG_MEMCG_SWAP: is required if you wish to limit swap usage of containers
 *   CONFIG_MEMCG_SWAP_ENABLED:  is not set when it should be.
 *   CONFIG_BLK_CGROUP:  is not set when it should be.
 *   CONFIG_CGROUP_PERF: is optional for container statistics gathering
 *   CONFIG_CFS_BANDWIDTH: is optional for container statistics gathering
 *   CONFIG_DM_THIN_PROVISIONING:        is not set when it should be.
 * Please check to make sure these options are set correctly.
 * Failure to do so may cause unexpected problems.
```

在gentoo wiki中还需要添加`Device mapper debugging support`

```
CONFIG_DM_DEBUG=y
```

## post-install

```
 * To use Docker, the Docker daemon must be running as root. To automatically
 * start the Docker daemon at boot, add Docker to the default runlevel:
 *   rc-update add docker default
 * Similarly for systemd:
 *   systemctl enable docker.service
 * 
 * To use Docker as a non-root user, add yourself to the 'docker' group:
 *   usermod -aG docker youruser
```
