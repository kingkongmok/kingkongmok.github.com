### Adding a Wi-Fi Connection
To view the available Wi-Fi access points, issue a command as follows:

```
nmcli dev wifi list
```

```
SSID            MODE  CHAN  RATE     SIGNAL  BARS  SECURITY
FedoraTest     Infra  11    54 MB/s  98      ▂▄▆█  WPA1
Red Hat Guest  Infra  6     54 MB/s  97      ▂▄▆█  WPA2
Red Hat        Infra  6     54 MB/s  77      ▂▄▆_  WPA2 802.1X
* Red Hat        Infra  40    54 MB/s  66      ▂▄▆_  WPA2 802.1X
VoIP           Infra  1     54 MB/s  32      ▂▄__  WEP
MyCafe         Infra  11    54 MB/s  39      ▂▄__  WPA2
```

To create a Wi-Fi connection profile with static IP configuration, but allowing automatic DNS address assignment, issue a command as follows:

```
nmcli con add con-name MyCafe ifname wlan0 type wifi ssid MyCafe ip4 192.168.100.101/24 gw4 192.168.100.1
```

To set a WPA2 password, for example “caffeine”, issue commands as follows:

```
nmcli con modify MyCafe wifi-sec.key-mgmt wpa-psk
nmcli con modify MyCafe wifi-sec.psk caffeine
```

To change Wi-Fi state, issue a command in the following format:

```
nmcli radio wifi [on | off ]
```
