#Empress

Empress is a bootstrapped blogging template that leverages [EmberJS](http://emberjs.com/) and GitHub. Empress lets you author your blog posts in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), and uses git (and some Ruby hackery) to generate your blog on the fly. Empress leverages [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) to allow for easy styling.
